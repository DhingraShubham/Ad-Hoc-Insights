# Ad-Hoc-Insights
Project in SQL for AtliQ Hardware

Excited to share, that I successfully completed an SQL project inspired by the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 4, which focuses on real-world business scenario assessments using SQL. The project involved querying and generating outputs for 10 ad-hoc business requests, transforming raw data into actionable insights. To enhance decision-making, I created Power BI visuals, enabling management to make quick, data-driven strategic decisions efficiently.
Excited about the learning journey and the impact of structured data analysis!

Tools Used:

•	MySQL – To query data, generate reports, and extract required outputs efficiently.

•	Power BI – To develop visualizations based on SQL queries, enabling data-driven decision-making


Key Learnings from the Project:

✅ SQL Fundamentals – Strengthened understanding of core SQL functionality.

✅ Data Transformation Techniques – Mastered scalar functions, aggregate functions, and CASE statements for data manipulation.

✅ Query Structuring – Gained expertise in GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and TOP for efficient data retrieval.

✅ Advanced Query Methods – Worked with subqueries, joins, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions.

✅ Stored Procedures & Functions – Enhanced ability to write reusable SQL logic.

✅ Performance Optimization – Learned how indexes improve query efficiency.

This hands-on experience sharpened my ability to write efficient queries, deepened my SQL expertise, and improved my business understanding by turning raw data into actionable insights!
